Belbird is free software and branched from Flite

Flite it a fine speech synthesizer but it did not do
exactly what I wanted to. I have butchered it to create Bellbird.
The vast majority of code comes from Flite.  It has been
modified for the purposes of Bellbird.

The vast majority of files in bellbird have been modified (often
only in tiny ways). As such bellbird in a derivative work of a number
of different code sources.

Any code which appears only in bellbird has the following license:
